Assembly Instructions

PCBWay Ordering Parameters
PCBWay parameters are located in attached images in the following repo location:

files: PCBWay-Ordering-Parameters-01, PCBWay-Ordering-Parameters-02, PCBWay-Ordering-Parameters-03

Boards can be fabricated and assembled by PCBWay. Go to PCBWay's website and
click the PCB Assembly option. You can select how many assembled PCBs you would like.
Feel free to leave unique number of parts, SMT pads, and thru-holes blank. PCBWay
will populate those fields themselves.

Feel free to specify whatever surface finish you prefer. I used HASL with lead, but
if you feel more comfortable with lead-free, HASL lead-free and Immersion gold (ENIG)
are very economical options.


Note: PCBWay often asks about the cathode location for the LEDs. The cathode location
is as noted in the "KickStat-LED-Cathode-Mark.jpeg" file located here:

Note: I like to solder the SWD programming header myself (it's located on the bottom
of the board), but PCBWay could also solder the headers as well. You'll just need to
specify Assembly Side(s): as "Bottom side." It might cost a little extra, but still
very inexpensive as far as PCB assembly goes. You will also need to give them the part
number for the SWD 10-pin connector. I like these options:
